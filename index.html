    <h1>Welcome to my personal GitHub repository</h1>
    <p>Featuring a collection of my engineering and development projects.</p>
    <p><span class="blink">|</span></p>
    
    <h2>Main skills:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Proficient in C/C++, Python, and assembly for embedded software development, including kernel modules and device drivers.</li>
      <li>Experienced with debugging tools like GDB and JTAG, optimizing software across embedded platforms and system components.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Projects included in this repository:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>5G_IIoT_Hub:</b> Led the development of a 5G IIoT Hub for industrial motor control using Lattice FPGA boards, integrating RISC-V SoC for enhanced communication and control capabilities in Portland State University's ECE Capstone.</li>
      <li><b>Kernel_Dev:</b> Developed a Linux kernel module (char_dev.c) and a corresponding userspace program (userspace.c) for managing character devices. The project included a comprehensive build system managed through a Makefile for efficient compilation. It featured dynamic parameter handling, allowing runtime adjustments via module parameters to test device interactions.</li>
      <li><b>Comp_Architecture:</b> 3.1 cach_simlulator project implements a cache simulator which demonstrate my proficiency in memory management and system optimization within computer systems. 3.2 IC_Design repo includes Projects on CMOS design and resistive inverters, alongside advanced simulations of compound gates. 3.3 MIPS (under development)</li>
      <li><b>Robotic_Car:</b> Development of a robotic car with advanced image processing and AI algorithm (developed using Orange software) and obstacle avoidance for safe orbital operations.</li>
      <li><b>Arm_Assembly:</b> Programming of BeagleBone Black GPIO, interrupts, and timers for real-time LED control, demonstrating assembly language, hardware interfacing skills, and debugging tools like CCS and JTAG.</li>
      <li><b>Parking_SYS:</b> Design of a PCB for a Parking Counter System, integrating IR sensors and microcontroller for real-time parking space monitoring, displayed on a web app.</li>
      <li><b>Mars_Rover:</b> Simulation of a Mars Rover/Lander designed to deploy with a human astronaut and equipment payload without damage at a landing angle of 45 degrees.</li>
      <li><b>Websites:</b> Development of front-end and back-end for websites including the Cultural Division at the Embassy of the Sultanate of Oman in Washington D.C., and the Omani Student Society in Western Australia.</li>
      <li><b>Aeroponics:</b> An ESP32-Controlled Hydroponic System for plant-growing using microcontroller ship to control and interface with environmental needs.</li>
      <li><b>Water_Filter:</b> Development of an affordable household water treatment system presented to Engineers Without Borders.</li>
      <li><b>Robotic_Arm:</b> Creation of a prototype robotic arm for shapes detection with an ESP32 camera and collection of different objects.</li>
      <li><b>Sound_Filter:</b> Design and testing of a sound frequency-selective light system, allowing illumination of LEDs based on sound frequencies.</li>
      <li><b>Eng_Clock:</b> Digital clock application that displays time in various formats including standard time, hex, and binary calculation. Enhances time-reading skills, and supports multiple time zones for educational purposes.</li>
      <li><b>Grad_Counter:</b> Dynamic countdown application tailored for tracking time until my graduation :) featuring customizable dates, milestone tracking, and timely alerts as the event approaches.</li>
