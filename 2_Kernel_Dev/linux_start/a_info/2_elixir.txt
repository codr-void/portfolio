A. Search for "usb_device". In what file is the structure defined, and what are the first five
members of the struct?
ANS:
- Defined in usb.h file (/nclude/linux/usb.h). 
- The first five members of the struct are:
    (1) int devnum;
    (2) char devpath[16];
    (3) u32 route;
    (4) enum usb_device_state state;
    (5) enum usb_device_speed speed;

B. In what header file is the type declared for the 5th member of the struct? (hint: don't look in test tools or staging directories)
ANS:
- Declared in ch9.h (/include/uapi/linux/usb/ch9.h).

C. Include the entire enumeration declaration from above.
ANS:
	/* USB 2.0 defines three speeds, here's how Linux identifies them */

	enum usb_device_speed {
		USB_SPEED_UNKNOWN = 0,			/* enumerating */
		USB_SPEED_LOW, USB_SPEED_FULL,	/* usb 1.1 */
		USB_SPEED_HIGH,			/* usb 2.0 */
		USB_SPEED_WIRELESS,			/* wireless (usb 2.5) */
		USB_SPEED_SUPER,			/* usb 3.0 */
		USB_SPEED_SUPER_PLUS,			/* usb 3.1 */
	};
