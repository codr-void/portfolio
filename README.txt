# Projects Repository README

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository, featuring a collection of my engineering and development projects.
A. Main skills: 
* Proficient in C/C++, Python, and assembly for embedded software development, including kernel modules and device drivers.
* Experienced with debugging tools like GDB and JTAG, optimizing software across embedded platforms and system components.

B. projects included in this repository:

1. Websites - Development of front-end and back-end for websites including the Cultural Division at the Embassy of the Sultanate of Oman in Washington D.C., and the Omani Student Society in Western Australia.

2. Mars Rover - Simulation of a Mars Rover/Lander designed to deploy with a human astronaut and equipment payload without damage at a landing angle of 45 degrees.

3. Water Filter - Development of an affordable household water treatment system presented to Engineers Without Borders.

4. Aeroponics - An ESP32-Controlled Hydroponic System for plant-growing using microcontroller ship to control and interface with environmental needs.

5. Robotic Arm - Creation of a prototype robotic arm for shapes detection with an ESP32 camera and collection of different objects.

6. Robotic Car - Development of a robotic car with advanced image processing and AI algorithm (developed using Orange software) and obstacle avoidance for safe orbital operations.

7. Sound Filter - Design and testing of a sound frequency-selective light system, allowing illumination of LEDs based on sound frequencies.

8. Arm Assembly - Programming of BeagleBone Black GPIO, interrupts, and timers for real-time LED control, demonstrating assembly language, hardware interfacing skills, and debugging toools like CCS and JTAG.

9. Parking SYS - Design of a PCB for a Parking Counter System, integrating IR sensors and microcontroller for real-time parking space monitoring, displayed on a web app.

10.RISC-V based 5G IIoT Hub - Led the development of a 5G IIoT Hub for industrial motor control using Lattice FPGA boards, integrating RISC-V SoC for enhanced communication and control capabilities in Portland State University's ECE Capstone.

11. Kernel Module Development - Developed a Linux kernel module (char_dev.c) and a corresponding userspace program (userspace.c) for managing character devices. The project included a comprehensive build system managed through a Makefile for efficient compilation. It featured dynamic parameter handling, allowing runtime adjustments via module parameters to test device interactions.
